							<p>To introduce myself-I would characterize myself as an ambitious and adventurous person. It is probably this personality trait in me that sparked my passion in flying, and I worked hard to land myself an amazing opportunity to train as a commercial pilot. But when covid struck, life had other plans for me, and I found myself working as a “Business Analyst" in a freight-forwarding firm in Hyderabad</p>
							<p>A few interesting things about me. I am an avid gamer and athlete. I enjoy playing competitive strategy games and love playing racquet sports</p>
							<p>I am a currently pursuing my Master’s in Information Systems at University of Washington - Foster School of Business. I have a background in Computer Science with a particular and strong interest in the intersection of technology and business. My professional aspiration is to work in a field, possibly as a Associate Project Manager or data/business intelligence analyst, while also exploring opportunities in cybersecurity and tech consultancy. 
							</p>
							<p>Take a look into some of the things I love working on:</p>
							<div class="row">
							<ul>
								<li>Project Management</li>
